# dictionary README

The dictionary extension! Wow! So cool!

Have you ever wanted to look and sound really smart when writing README files? This is the extension for you!

When editing markdown files, you'll see that on hover definitions for words will come up.

If you double click a word to select it, then right click, in the context menu click `Show Synonyms` and select the synonym from the menu!

Wow so cool!
